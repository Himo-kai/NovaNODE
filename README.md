***It's a Scrapper*** -
 If you've ever played PACMAN<sup>TM</sup>. It's like that but with no 8-bit soundtrack. It takes    everything.

***Dig in Deep*** -
You set the crawl depth and page limits. Want to scrape 3 levels deep? Fine. Want to hit 500 pages? Done. Your call.

***Formatted for A.I Assistance*** -
Output is formatted for AI consumption. No extra processing needed - dump it straight into your models and they'll understand it. Saving those precious Tokens used on web analysis.

***Documentation*** -
Works especially well on documentation sites like Redis.io. Automatically identifies API docs, parameters, and examples without special configuration.

***Low Profile*** -
Avoid's bot detection, Modifies headers, spoofs fingerprinting, and mimics regular browser behavior. Not foolproof, but effective.

***Simple and Clean*** -
Basic command-line interface. Nothing fancy - just flags that work. Set a few parameters and let it run.

***Nova Sama*** -
Extracts key concepts, terminology, and builds references creating a logical structure for navigation, content, documentation, and code examples all organized separately. So it makes sense when you look at it.
